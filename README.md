# S3-BLOG

A simple blog template that can be hosted with AWS S3 Static Web Hosting.

This has been written with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It relies on the [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) libraries.

The scripting will read the .md files from the `articles` directory and convert it to HTML code.
The `num_of_articles` in the `main.js` files should be updated to reflect the number of articles existing in the folder.
